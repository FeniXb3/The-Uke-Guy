# The Uke Guy 
# Ludum Dare 32

Gameplay and controls show - https://youtu.be/xuwcVbgKTHU

The game is about a musician, who sits by the street and plays his instrument.
However, he is not an ordinary musician - he is The Uke Guy! He uses ukulele
as a weapon to fight with sadness!

You have to play a part of someone's happy song as he approaches to make him happy.
After hearing a part of the song he will run to you and ask you to play more!

Controls:
There are 4 basic sounds, as there are 4 strings in uke. The controls to trigger them:

G - [Shift]

C - [Enter]

E - [Backslash]

A - [Backspace]


An additional sound:

DRUM - [Ctrl]

For each string there are 5 frets you can push before picking the string - this will
make a different sound! If a Sad Guy wants you to play a sound on a string with
a fret, the number of the fret will be displayed with the string name.

Buttons on your keyboard corresponding frets for different strings:

G - [z], [x], [c], [v], [b]

C - [a], [s], [d], [f], [g]

E - [q], [w], [e], [r], [t]

A - [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]

So, to play a sound that is on first fret of G string, you have to press and hold [z]
and then press [Shift]

Unfortunately, I didn't have time to create more sad people for our Uke Guy to save
from sadness, so there is not much chalange in the game. However, you can still
play on your keyboard like on the 5-fretted ukulele!

BTW, you can try playing some chords and strumming up and down. To play F chord:

1. press and hold [q]

2. press and hold [x]

3. "strum" down or up by sliding your finger from [Shift] to [Enter] to [Backslash] to [Backspace].
